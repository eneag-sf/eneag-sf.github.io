      <title>My experience as a 1:1 Trailblazer Mentor</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-it-started"><a href="#How-it-started" class="headerlink" title="How it started"></a>How it started</h2><p>A month ago, before attending #dreamforce, I applied to be a Trailbalzer 1:1 Mentor to help other Trailblazer onboard on the salesforce ecosystem so they can explore new career opportunities. My goal was to make new trailblazers feel welcome in the ecosystem, broaden their network, inspire them and also answer any question that they might have regarding the salesforce career.</p><h2 id="Acceptance-email-amp-Eligibility-criterias"><a href="#Acceptance-email-amp-Eligibility-criterias" class="headerlink" title="Acceptance email &amp; Eligibility criterias"></a>Acceptance email &amp; Eligibility criterias</h2><p>After a couple of days, I got an Email confirming that I have been accepted as a Mentor and that I have been matched with a Mentee. </p><blockquote><p> Hi Enea, Congratulations!<br>You‚Äôve been accepted as a Trailblazer Mentorship 1:1 Mentor. We‚Äôre excited for you to start your journey as a mentor in the program. You will undoubtedly be an invaluable asset to our job seekers as they pursue their next opportunity in the Salesforce ecosystem.</p><footer><strong>Trailblazer Connect </strong><cite>Mentorship Programme</cite></footer></blockquote><p><img src="/2022/10/09/trailblazerMentor/mentorship.png" alt="Trailblazer Mentorship 1:1"></p><p><a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazerconnect/mentorship/?icid=SFDC:b-trailblzer:b-trailblazer-page#reqs-section">Here</a> is the link to apply as a Mentor or as a Mentee. At the moment, the Mentor Circles applications are cloosed, but you can apply for a One-on-One Mentorship (same as I did).</p><p>Check <a href="https://trailblazermentorshipcircles.splashthat.com/">here</a> the application tips but also the eligibility criterias which are very important. </p><h2 id="Being-a-1-1-Mentor"><a href="#Being-a-1-1-Mentor" class="headerlink" title="Being a 1:1 Mentor"></a>Being a 1:1 Mentor</h2><p>As soon as I got the acceptance email, I reached out to my mentee so we could align on the first meeting. As my mentee was in (GMT-5) timezone we had to both agree on a timeline which would suit us best.</p><p>She is very motivated and also gaining a lot of experience in Salesforce by completing badges&#x2F;superbadged weekly.</p><p>I support her in the following mentor guidance tasks: </p><ul><li>support with professional goals</li><li>create a career plan, review CV, and preparation or mocks for job interviews</li><li>connect her with recruiters in her region</li><li>help her out when choosing trailhead modules which are relevant for job interviews</li><li>answer various questions regarding the career, etc</li></ul><h2 id="Tips"><a href="#Tips" class="headerlink" title="Tips"></a>Tips</h2><p>I would always suggest to connect your Mentees with their local Trailblazer Groups (Admin, Women in Tech, etc). They are very helpful to extend their network which might lead to them landing a job faster. It also of course increases their confidence. Bonus points if they are active and participate as a speaker, which would look great in the CV.</p><h2 id="Helpful-Resources-PDF-preview-works-only-on-Desktop-version-üìµ"><a href="#Helpful-Resources-PDF-preview-works-only-on-Desktop-version-üìµ" class="headerlink" title="Helpful Resources (PDF preview works only on Desktop version üìµ)"></a>Helpful Resources (PDF preview works only on Desktop version üìµ)</h2><p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Trailblazer Mentorship <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/groups/0F93A000000LnslSAC?tab=discussion">Group</a>, which is very helpful to answer any questions after you have joined the programme</p><p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Mentor welcome <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/live/videos/a2r3k000001WFPu/trailblazer-mentorship-giving-back-through-mentoring/">video</a> to find out more about Mentors</p><p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Mentee welcome <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/live/videos/a2r3k000001WFPz/trailblazer-mentorship-mentee-welcome-resources-and-tips-for-success/">video</a> to find out more about Mentees</p><p>4Ô∏è‚É£ Trailblazer Mentorship Career Resources</p><div class="row">    <embed src="TrailblazerMentorshipCareerResources.pdf" width="100%" height="550" type="application/pdf"></div><p>5Ô∏è‚É£ Trailblazer Mentor Playbook</p><div class="row">    <embed src="TrailblazerMentorshipMentorPlayBook.pdf" width="100%" height="550" type="application/pdf"></div><p>6Ô∏è‚É£ Trailblazer Mentorship Mentee Playbook</p><div class="row">    <embed src="TrailblazerMentorshipMenteePlaybook.pdf" width="100%" height="550" type="application/pdf"></div><p>7Ô∏è‚É£ Here is an FAQ if you are unfamiliar with the Trailbalzer 1:1 Mentorship Programme. </p><div class="row">    <embed src="TrailblazerMentorshipFAQ.pdf" width="100%" height="550" type="application/pdf"></div>]]></content>
